aws-mlep_v1.0
=============

Cloud-Based Optimization (AWS) component for MLE+.

Requirements
------------
* UNIX Machine: aws-mlep can only be run on a unix-machine. This limitations is due to the 
* AWS account credentials 
* Matlab

3. Run the installation file 
4. 


Examples
========
We have setup 4 different example projects that should be available to run as long as you have a AWS account. AWS-MLEP allows you to perform parametric simulation and search optimization by implementing a Genetic Algorithm. In each of these two categories we can optimized for design as well as run-time parameters. By design parameters we mean wall thickness, construction materials and
